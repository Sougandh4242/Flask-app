# Flask Application with MongoDB Database Connection

This is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates how to connect to a MongoDB database. It allows you to add and delete todo items.

## Tools

- Python
- Flask
- MongoDB
- pymongo (Python MongoDB driver)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask pymongo
```

Start the MongoDB server in your command prompt:

```bash
mongosh
```

Create a MongoDB database named flask_db and a collection named todos where your data will be stored.

Running the Application
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can access it in your web browser.

Usage
To add a new todo item, visit the homepage and use the form to submit a task and its degree of importance.

To delete a todo item, click on the "Delete" button next to the item.

Project Structure
app.py: The main Flask application.
templates/index.html: HTML template for rendering the list of todo items.
